A news article discusses current or recent news of either general interest (i.e. daily newspapers) or on a specific topic (i.e. political or trade news magazines, club newsletters, or technology news websites). A news article can include accounts of eyewitnesses to the happening event. We must have seen the news divided into categories when we go to a news website. Some of the popular categories that you’ll see on almost any news website are tech, entertainment, sports, etc.News topic classification is a method of classifying news articles available in text data into some predefined classes or labels. This is one of the applications of text classification.

In this project a CNN model is used to classify Persian news into 5 main topics: Sports, Business, Politics, Entertainment, Tech
